# nodeprofilegenerator
A node application to dynamically generate a profile from a given GitHub repository. The user is asked to enter their favourite color and the username of their GitHub profile. 

![Input](/images/input.jpg?raw=true "Input") 

The color input is used for the background of the profiles's information cards.

![Cards](/images/cardSS.jpg?raw=true "Cards") 

After recieving both the inputs a html file is generated with the users main information displayed, including location, GitHub link, number of repositories, following and stars.

![Profile](/images/profileSS.jpg?raw=true "Profile") 

It is then converted into a pdf and saved with the username being used as the unique file name.

![PDF](/images/pdfSS.jpg?raw=true "PDF")



still need to fix:
- github stars
